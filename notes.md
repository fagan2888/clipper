There is whitespace in 'AgencyName', 'PaymentProductName', 'RouteName' - needs to be stripped.

Passes that have non-zero vaules:
'AC Transit Adult local (31 Day Rolling) pass' (These are upgrades for Transbay Trips)
'AC Transit Youth local (31 Day Rolling) pass' (As above)
'Caltrain ED 2 zone Monthly pass' (These are $1 zone upgrades; presumably regular pass also has zone upgrades)
'SF Muni Adult Fastpass' (These are BART fares)

Pass notes:
 - Caltrain 'MUNI' passes costs Caltrain cost + $61 for Muni
 - Assumed $100 average for AC Transit EasyPass
 - Made similar assumptions about VTA EcoPass ($30/$100/$120 for University/Standard/Express)
 - WETA Universal Pass asusmed to be for employees as not noted on website, only 12 tags recorded - ignored
 - Golden Gate Ferry adds a $0 dollar transaction noting ferry route, while the actual cost goes out as 'Translink E-Cash'
 - 'Tokens' are free transfers between different parts of the system.
 - 'SFMTA Youth Pilot'  and 'RTC' fares are both free programs
 - Not sure why these SFMTA trips are $0:
    SF Muni Adult Round Trip
    SF Muni Adult Single Ride
    SF Muni Senior Round Trip
    SF Muni Senior Single Ride
    SF Muni Youth Round Trip
    SF Muni Youth Single Ride
 - 'VTA Day Pass Accumulator' is logged once passengers hit the $6 daily maximum on VTA
 - See Caltrain ridership report for monthly pass ratio: http://www.caltrain.com/Assets/_MarketDevelopment/pdf/Caltrain+Origin+$!26+Destination+Survey+2014.pdf?v=2
 
 Fare notes:
 - AC Transit EasyPass could be Local or Transbay, assuming $2.5 average
 - Same assumption for VTA Express ECO Pass
 - BART fares in SF are $1.85 (for SF Muni Adult Fastpass)
